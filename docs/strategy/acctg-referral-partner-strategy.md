# Long Island BID and OZ referral partner strategy for PlexifyAEC

The accounting and consulting landscape for Long Island Business Improvement Districts and Opportunity Zones is concentrated among **9 key firms** with identifiable professionals to target, creating a realistic 12-18 month outreach strategy for PlexifyAEC/PlexifyBID. The **December 31, 2026 federal OZ deadline** creates immediate urgency for OZ-focused partnerships, while active **$70+ million in DRI/NY Forward funding** across Long Island communities presents BID capital improvement opportunities requiring construction technology oversight.

The most promising referral partners are **Anchin** (dedicated OZ group with Long Island office), **Novogradac** (unrivaled OZ technical authority), **CohnReznick** (top-10 construction accounting practice with OZ expertise), and **Cerini & Associates** (deep Long Island nonprofit relationships). Each offers distinct value for different Plexify product lines and client segments.

## Tier 1: High-priority Long Island accounting partners

**Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP** presents the strongest immediate opportunity with a **dedicated Economic Opportunity Zones Group** led by **Paul Gevertzman, CPA, J.D.** (paul.gevertzman@anchin.com, 212-840-3456). Gevertzman serves on the **Board of Directors of Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corp**, demonstrating direct economic development agency relationships. Anchin opened a **Long Island office in Uniondale** in February 2021 and their Managing Partner **Russell B. Shinsky** is a lifelong Long Island resident named to LIBN's 2023 Top 25 Influencers in Accounting.

Key Anchin contacts for initial outreach:
- **Paul Gevertzman** — OZ Group Leader, Tax Credits & Incentives Co-Leader, Construction/A&E Tax Leader
- **Robert Gilman** — Real Estate Group Leader, Long Island Business News Lifetime Achievement Award 2024
- **Phillip Ross** — Construction Industry Group Co-Leader, Top 50 Construction Accounting Firms recognition
- **Brian Sanvidge** — Regulatory Compliance Leader, appointed **official monitor for Orange County IDA** in 2024

Anchin's **annual Future Forward conference** brings together NYC developers, construction executives, and economic development officials—an ideal venue for thought leadership positioning.

**Cerini & Associates LLP** owns Long Island's nonprofit and special district market with offices in **Bohemia and Syosset**, serving school districts, nonprofits, and municipalities across the region. Managing Partner **Kenneth Cerini, CPA, CFP** is recognized as a nonprofit thought leader frequently quoted in Newsday and Long Island Business News. He founded the **Long Island Imagine Awards** recognizing nonprofit excellence. Partner **Joseph Sciacca** (joined via 2022 merger) brings specific construction and real estate expertise. Cerini's strength is BID accounting and audit work rather than OZ structuring.

**Marcum LLP/CBIZ** operates from **10 Melville Park Road in Melville** with significant real estate and construction practices. Following the November 2024 CBIZ acquisition, key contacts include **Carolyn Mazzenga** (Long Island Office Managing Partner), **Daniel Castellano** (Long Island Construction Services Leader), and **Abe Schlisselfeld** (Real Estate Industry Leader, abe.schlisselfeld@cbiz.com). Marcum has published extensive OZ thought leadership and their real estate practice serves REITs, institutional investors, developers, and private equity funds. Note: Research could not confirm a "Michael S. Brown" with BID/OZ expertise at Marcum—direct inquiry recommended.

## National firms with deep OZ structuring capabilities

**Novogradac & Company LLP** stands alone as the preeminent OZ technical authority, having founded the industry's OZ Working Group in 2017 and provided direct testimony to Congress. Their **Empire State Building office** (350 Fifth Avenue, Suite 4500, 212-354-6305) serves Long Island clients. Managing Partner **Michael J. Novogradac** was named a top 25 OZ Influencer in 2019 and 2021 and authored the definitive OZ Handbook. **Jason Watkins, CPA** leads the OZ Working Group and chairs OZ conferences nationally. Novogradac maintains the industry's leading **OZ fund database** (100+ funds, $23B+ capacity) and recently launched **OZ 2.0 mapping tools** for the 2027 designation cycle.

For developers using Qualified Opportunity Funds, Novogradac provides the compliance testing and "substantial improvement" analysis essential to construction projects. A referral partnership here positions Plexify as the construction technology component of a complete OZ development solution.

**CohnReznick** combines strong OZ advisory with a **#9 national ranking in construction accounting** (50+ partners leading 150+ practitioners). Their **New York office at 1301 Avenue of Americas** has Long Island coverage. Key contacts include **Ira Weinstein** (co-author of "The Guide to Making Opportunity Zones Work"), **Dennis Park** (OZ funds, LIHTC, historic tax credits), and **Scott Damiecki** (Construction Industry Practice Leader as of February 2024). CohnReznick's 30+ years in community development finance and expertise layering OZ with LIHTC creates natural construction oversight opportunities.

**KPMG** is the **only Big Four firm with a dedicated Long Island office** (1305 Walt Whitman Road, Melville—150+ professionals, nearly 60 years of local presence). Managing Partner **Tony Dalessio** leads the office. KPMG's government and municipal advisory practice serves state and local entities with economic development consulting, though their OZ work is integrated into broader tax advisory rather than a dedicated practice.

## Long Island BID landscape and procurement patterns

Research identified **six active Long Island area BIDs** with distinct governance structures. The **Long Island City Partnership** (technically Queens but regionally associated) has the largest operation with $1.52M annual revenue, led by President **Laura Rothrock** (laura.rothrock@licpartnership.org, 718-786-5300). Rothrock previously served as BID Program Executive Director at NYC Department of Small Business Services, overseeing $100M contract management for nearly 70 BIDs. Board Chair **David Brause** (Brause Realty) and Treasurer **Paula Kirby** (Plaxall, Inc.) are key decision-makers.

The **Village of Patchogue BID** appointed **David Kennedy** as Executive Director in October 2024, following 20+ years of service by Dennis Smith. Kennedy's government background (former Village Trustee, NYS Assembly staff) suggests receptivity to efficiency-enhancing technology. Mayor **Paul Pontieri** influences BID vendor selection. Current projects include the Hilton Tempo Hotel, solar carports, and streetscape improvements.

**BID procurement patterns** favor local/regional firms with nonprofit experience. Board connections matter significantly—accounting firm partners frequently serve on nonprofit boards. Key procurement insights:

- Organizations with $1M+ revenue require independent CPA audits (Form 990 and CHAR500 filings)
- Capital projects typically use competitive bidding with engineering oversight
- Professional services follow RFQ/RFP processes reviewed by board committees
- Long-term relationships are common, creating barriers for new entrants

**Cullen & Danowski, LLP** (Port Jefferson Station) serves the local nonprofit and municipal market with 7 partners and 40+ professionals. Senior Partner **James E. Danowski** has local board connections. This firm represents a potential "gateway" referral partner for smaller BID relationships.

## Empire State Development OZ program and critical deadlines

New York has **514 designated Opportunity Zones** including concentrations in Nassau County (Hempstead, Glen Cove, Long Beach) and limited Suffolk County coverage (Calverton/EPCAL, Wyandanch, Riverhead, North Bellport). A critical consideration: **New York partially decoupled from federal OZ benefits effective January 1, 2021**—state taxpayers cannot defer capital gains for QOF investments at the state level, though the 10-year appreciation exclusion remains.

The **December 31, 2026 deadline** for recognizing all deferred gains is NOT extended, creating a 2025-2026 window for advisory services around exit planning, compliance finalization, and transition to OZ 2.0. The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025** makes the OZ program permanent with new provisions effective January 1, 2027:

- 5-year rolling deferral period (replacing fixed 2026 date)
- 10% permanent basis step-up after 5 years
- 30% step-up for Qualified Rural Opportunity Funds
- New zone designations by July 1, 2026 (states), effective January 2027
- At least 25% rural zone requirement per state

**ESD Long Island Regional Office** contact: **Cara Longworth, Regional Director** (631-435-0717, longisland@esd.ny.gov), 115 Broadhollow Road, Suite 250, Melville. The **Long Island Forward Housing Program** provides no-cost technical assistance for multifamily development—potential referral source.

## Current Long Island development projects with OZ and BID intersections

**Link Apartments in Village of Hempstead** represents an active OZ investment: 173 units developed by **Grubb Properties** (Charlotte-based QOZ Fund) with local partner **First Street Capital** (Rashid Walker, Founder). The project has a 25-year PILOT from Town of Hempstead IDA requiring ongoing compliance monitoring—a natural technology/accounting service need.

**Station Yards (Ronkonkoma Hub)** is the region's flagship TOD: **$1.2 billion investment** by **TRITEC Real Estate Company** (Principal: Jim Coughlan) with $55 million ESD capital grant. Upon completion: 1,450 residential units, 360,000 SF office, 195,000 SF retail. Phase 2 ("The Core") is actively under construction.

**Wyandanch Village** ($500 million, **Albanese Organization** master developer) is in an Opportunity Zone with identified professional services: A3 Construction LLC (contractor), BHC Architects, Cannon Heyman & Weiss LLP (attorneys), Best Development Group (consultant). Economic/financial consulting by **Dr. Martin R. Cantor, CPA** for Riverhead Town Square provides a potential thought leadership collaborator.

**DRI and NY Forward awards total $70+ million** across Long Island communities:
- Village of Hempstead (2024): $10M DRI
- Smithtown-Kings Park (2023): $10M DRI
- Huntington Station (2022): $10M DRI with **BJH Advisors** as prime consultant
- Farmingdale (2024): $4.5M NY Forward
- Mineola, North Bellport (2023): $4.5M NY Forward each

## Technology referral partnership models that resonate

Successful construction technology partnerships with accounting firms follow predictable patterns. **Procore** maintains integrations with major accounting platforms (QuickBooks, Sage Intacct, Xero) and a partner directory including consulting firms like **Wipfli** that delivers advisory services to contractors. The 2022 Procore-Xero partnership demonstrates the "single source of truth" positioning that resonates with accounting partners. **Sage** has 50,000+ construction business clients with Authorized Reseller, Development Partner, and Accountant Partner tiers—**Cherry Bekaert** earned their Partner Platinum Club recognition.

**CICPAC (Construction Industry CPAs)** provides direct access to **75+ accounting firms with 1,200+ CPAs** serving 13,000+ construction companies—likely the highest-value association for Plexify to target. Annual conferences enable tech-CPA relationship building.

Value propositions that resonate with accounting partners:

1. **Revenue opportunities** — 20-30% referral commissions for introductions, recurring revenue from ongoing client relationships
2. **Advisory enablement** — Technology that shifts CPAs from compliance to strategic advisory (113% increase in average monthly billing per Thomson Reuters research)
3. **Integration excellence** — Seamless connections with existing accounting software, open APIs, single source of truth for financial data
4. **Thought leadership collaboration** — Joint webinars, co-authored content, conference speaking opportunities
5. **AI positioning** — Frame capabilities as enabling CPAs to serve clients better, not replacing them (critical messaging per CPA.com research)

**Digits Accountant Partner Program** offers a model for AI-native positioning: training focused on helping firms structure for AI advantages, firm-specific AI model development, and certification programs.

## Recommended outreach strategy and prioritization

**Immediate priority (Q1 2025)**: Target **Anchin** through Paul Gevertzman or Robert Gilman with a thought leadership proposal around OZ 2.0 transition planning. Their Future Forward conference (typically Q4) provides a speaking opportunity. Simultaneously approach **Cerini & Associates** through Kenneth Cerini with a BID capital improvement technology positioning aligned with their nonprofit focus.

**Q2 2025**: Engage **Novogradac** through their OZ Working Group with a construction technology integration discussion—position Plexify as the project-level data source for "substantial improvement" compliance testing. Contact **CohnReznick's** Scott Damiecki (construction practice leader) about construction/OZ synergies.

**Q3-Q4 2025**: Approach **CICPAC** for association partnership or conference participation. Target **KPMG Long Island** through Tony Dalessio for municipal advisory-related opportunities.

**BID-specific approach**: Contact **David Kennedy** (Patchogue BID) as a new executive potentially receptive to technology solutions. Reference current capital projects. For Long Island City Partnership, approach through board members with development backgrounds (David Brause, Patricia Dunphy at Rockrose) rather than through staff.

**Association leverage**: Join **LIREG (Long Island Real Estate Group)** and **HIA-LI (Hauppauge Industrial Association)**—Anchin holds memberships in both. Position Plexify representatives at LIREDC events where development projects are showcased.

**2026 urgency messaging**: Frame all OZ-related outreach around the December 31, 2026 deadline and transition to permanent program. Accounting firms will have heightened client engagement through this period—position Plexify as enabling that advisory work with construction-level project visibility.

| Priority Tier | Firm | Primary Contact | Engagement Approach |
|--------------|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Anchin | Paul Gevertzman | OZ thought leadership, Future Forward |
| 1 | Cerini & Associates | Kenneth Cerini | BID capital improvement focus |
| 2 | Novogradac | Jason Watkins | OZ compliance technology integration |
| 2 | CohnReznick | Scott Damiecki | Construction practice alignment |
| 3 | Marcum/CBIZ | Carolyn Mazzenga | Long Island real estate practice |
| 3 | KPMG | Tony Dalessio | Municipal advisory angle |
| 4 | UHY | Mehmet Sengulen | M&A/technology focus |
| 4 | Boris Benic | Robert Puerto | Real estate/construction specialty |

The referral partner strategy should emphasize Plexify's value as an "AI consulting ally" that enhances advisory capacity rather than competing with it—enabling accounting partners to deliver more strategic value during the critical 2025-2026 OZ transition period and ongoing BID capital improvement oversight.
