MARKET CONTEXT

The Financial District has undergone a dramatic transformation from a purely commercial district to one of Manhattan's fastest-growing residential neighborhoods. Key market dynamics include:

1. Post-Pandemic Demand Shift: Remote work has increased demand for larger residential units with dedicated home office space. FiDi's newer housing stock is well-positioned for this trend.

2. Infrastructure Investment: The completion of the Fulton Center transit hub and ongoing improvements to the World Trade Center campus have significantly improved neighborhood accessibility.

3. Competitive Landscape: Major residential projects in the area include 50 West Street (Helmut Jahn), One Manhattan Square, and 125 Greenwich Street. The Silverstein project differentiates through height, views, and WTC campus integration.

4. Price Point: Comparable luxury condos in Lower Manhattan are trading at $1,800-$2,500 per square foot. The premium positioning of 175 Greenwich could command $2,200-$3,000/SF depending on floor and view orientation.

OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT

Our firm's value proposition for this project centers on three capabilities:

1. Safety & Compliance Technology: With the complex regulatory environment surrounding WTC-adjacent development, our safety monitoring platform can provide real-time compliance tracking during the 3-4 year construction phase. The post-9/11 building codes for this area are among the most stringent in the world.

2. Digital Twin Integration: The supertall design requires sophisticated monitoring during construction. Our sensor network and digital twin platform can provide structural monitoring, wind load analysis, and construction progress tracking.

3. Owner's Rep Technology Support: Silverstein has a track record of adopting technology for project management. Their existing portfolio includes advanced BMS systems, and they are receptive to innovation that improves construction efficiency and reduces risk.

Estimated Contract Value: $2.4M - $3.8M over the project lifecycle
Win Probability: 65% (based on existing relationship with Silverstein PM team)
Competition: Autodesk Construction Cloud, Newforma, Oracle Aconex

WARM INTRODUCTION PATHS

1. Direct: Our CEO served on a panel with Tal Kerret at the NYC Real Estate Technology Week in October 2025. Follow-up meeting was discussed but not scheduled.

2. Via Tishman: We have an active contract with Tishman Construction on the Hudson Yards Phase 2 project. If Tishman wins the GC contract for 175 Greenwich, this becomes a warm referral.

3. Via WSP Engineering: Our sensor technology was evaluated by WSP for the Merdeka 118 project in Kuala Lumpur. Positive technical review could translate to a recommendation.

4. Industry Event: REBNY Spring Conference in April 2026 — Marty Burger is a confirmed speaker. This is the strongest near-term opportunity for a face-to-face introduction.

---

KEY RISKS

1. Timeline Uncertainty: The project is still in pre-development. Any delay in financing or regulatory approval pushes our engagement window.

2. Market Correction: A luxury condo market downturn could cause Silverstein to scale back or pause the project. Current market indicators are positive but interest rate sensitivity remains high.

3. Competitive Displacement: Autodesk has a strong existing relationship with Silverstein Properties through BIM 360 on other projects. Displacing an incumbent requires a clear ROI narrative.

4. Budget Sensitivity: At $2.4M-$3.8M, our solution is a significant line item. We need to frame this as risk mitigation (insurance cost reduction, regulatory penalty avoidance) rather than pure technology spend.

5. Political Risk: WTC-area development carries unique political sensitivities. Any controversy around the project could create delays that impact our timeline.

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. [Week 1] Request intro to Tal Kerret through our CEO's existing connection
2. [Week 2] Prepare customized safety monitoring demo using FiDi/WTC regulatory requirements
3. [Week 3] Schedule technical deep-dive with WSP engineering team
4. [Month 2] Submit formal capability statement to Silverstein procurement
5. [Month 3] Target REBNY Spring Conference for executive-level meeting with Marty Burger
